A 2D side-scroller platform action game made in Unity. 
It revolves around this robot which is the first of its kind, hosting an AI system that allows for it to develop and control itself.
Fight the enemies, change weapons and move in an intelligent manner to get to the finish line. 
3 challenging levels await with a surprise at the end.
Be careful and enjoy!

All assets were created by me.
